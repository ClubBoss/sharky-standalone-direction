What it is
This playbook turns bankroll, variance, and session-management choices into stable frequency shifts using one compact action set: 3bet_ip_9bb, 3bet_oop_12bb, 4bet_ip_21bb, 4bet_oop_24bb, small_cbet_33, half_pot_50, big_bet_75, size_up_wet, size_down_dry, protect_check_range, delay_turn, probe_turns, double_barrel_good, triple_barrel_scare, call, fold, overfold_exploit. You keep the same trees and sizes. You adjust how often you use them based on bankroll tier, soft windows, and execution load.

Why it matters
Bankroll and variance policy changes EV/hour more than micro in-hand tweaks. Proper caps, shot rules, and texture-consistent sizing prevent tilt lines and keep decisions reliable when scaling tables. The mantra is physics first, reads second: texture picks size family; bankroll and load move frequencies.

Rules of thumb



* Stop-loss/win: set guardrails. Under fatigue trim thin calls and triple_barrel_scare; add delay_turn and protect_check_range. Why: error rate grows faster than edge.
* Soft windows: expect fast folds and passive rivers. Widen 3bet_oop_12bb and 3bet_ip_9bb with blockers, tag overfold_exploit; take thinner half_pot_50 value. Why: immediate folds and merged calls increase.
* Tough pools: fewer speculative calls IP/OOP; fold more versus big_bet_75 without blockers. Why: under-bluffed polar nodes.
* Texture discipline: size_down_dry on A83r or K72r with small_cbet_33; size_up_wet on JT9ss or 986ss with big_bet_75 when equity and blockers support pressure. Why: volatility needs leverage support.
* Preflop ladders steady: 3bet/4bet sizes never change; widen or tighten frequency only. Why: consistent ladders lower mistakes.
* Multiway or high variance tables: prefer half_pot_50 over big_bet_75 unless you hold nut advantage and blockers. Why: realization drops multiway.
* Recovery mode after downswings: simplify plans, default to small_cbet_33, half_pot_50, delay_turn; protect_check_range in stab-prone nodes. Why: stabilize redline and reduce punt risk.
* EV/hour triage: leave tough lists, join soft waitlists. Softer table selection beats small in-hand edges. Map to more overfold_exploit and fewer hero calls. Why: better immediate yield.

Mini example
Late-night soft window HU 100bb. In lobby you see many short stacks and few 4-bets. Preflop: widen 3bet_oop_12bb with A5s and tag overfold_exploit. 3-bet pot A82r, pot ~18bb: small_cbet_33 (size_down_dry). Turn 9c in a pool that tanks then folds to pressure: half_pot_50 as double_barrel_good; reserve big_bet_75 for dynamic cards with blockers. Two hours later you move from 6 to 12 tables. Under load, you shift toward small_cbet_33, more delay_turn with medium strength, and fewer triple_barrel_scare attempts unless scare + blockers are clear. On polar big river bets without blockers, fold. If the shot drops by the preset stop-loss, revert stake and keep the same tokens at lower frequency.

Common mistakes

* Off-tree sizes under tilt or overload. Why it happens: urgency bias. Fix: keep 33/50/75 only; shift frequency.
* Forcing big_bet_75 on dry rivers. Why it happens: desire to win the pot now. Fix: size_down_dry thin value or check.
* Shot-taking with no exit rules. Why it happens: optimism. Fix: predefine stop-loss/win and revert plan.
* Refusing to leave tough pools. Why it happens: sunk-cost fallacy. Fix: join soft waitlists; map to overfold_exploit and thin half_pot_50 value.

Mini-glossary
Bankroll tier: stake band that sets table caps and shot rules; shifts frequencies, not sizes.
Shot: temporary move up with preset exits; favor small_cbet_33, half_pot_50.
Risk-of-ruin (intuitive): chance of bust given winrate and stdev; lower it by table caps and discipline.
BB/100: winrate metric that interacts with variance and sample size.
stdev/100: volatility metric; higher means more discipline and fewer thin bluffs.
Soft window: time block with weaker pools; widen 3bet frequencies and value with half_pot_50.
Stop-loss/win: session guardrails that trigger exits or cooldowns.
Table cap: max concurrent tables tied to accuracy; higher caps mean simpler lines.
Autopilot: reduced attention mode; keep sizes simple and protect checks.
Execution load: cognitive demand from tables and session length; bias to delay_turn and protect_check_range.

Contrast
This module adjusts frequencies using bankroll, variance, and load. It does not add sizes or tokens. The same HU and postflop tokens carry over to 6-max and MTT contexts.
