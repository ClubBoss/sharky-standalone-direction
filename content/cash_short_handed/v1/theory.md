What it is
Short-handed means playing 4-5 handed most of the session and sometimes 3-handed on 6-max tables. With fewer players, ranges widen, position changes value faster, and the blinds come around more often. You open first-in more, defend blinds more, and face more heads-up pots while keeping the same size families but higher action frequencies.

Why it matters
More steals and defenses create many marginal nodes. Rake per hand is similar, but you pay blinds more often. 3-bets lower SPR so decisions simplify and blockers matter more. Population leaks amplify: under-defended blinds, over-cbet on low boards, and overfolds to OOP turn barrels. Disciplined, size-led plans convert these into EV.

Rules of thumb
- First-in opens: widen when 4-5 handed, but tighten if a hyper-aggressive reg sits on your left. Prefer BTN and SB steals; trim weakest offsuit opens in CO under pressure. Why: position flips value faster and bad seats punish loose opens.
- 3-bet families: use 3bet_ip_9bb in position and 3bet_oop_12bb out of position; add value and blocker bluffs versus BTN and SB steals, stay value-lean versus earlier seats in 5-handed. Why: leverage and realization gap grow as ranges widen.
- 4-bet families: 4bet_ip_21bb and 4bet_oop_24bb keep leverage and tidy SPR; deploy more versus frequent 3-bettors and bluff less versus tight ranges. Why: clean geometry sets stack-off bands and preserves fold equity.
- Flop sizes: small_cbet_33 on dry Axx/Kxx; half_pot_50 on middling boards; big_bet_75 only when size_up_wet is justified by strong equity or clear nut advantage. Why: texture drives denial efficiency and value thickness.
- Lines and geometry: after a 3-bet, SPR ~3-5; favor initiative and position. Default small_cbet_33 IP and half_pot_50 OOP unless size_up_wet; protect_check_range OOP on middling textures; use delay_turn and probe_turns when the turn favors you. Why: timing plus position realizes equity and avoids bloated guessing OOP.
- SB strategy: raise-first-in is preferred short-handed; complete only with clear multiway incentives. Tighten completes if BTN is sticky or 3-bets often. Why: fewer players reduce multiway value and reward initiative.

Mini example
UTG folds, MP folds, CO opens 2.3bb, BTN 3-bets to 9bb (3bet_ip_9bb); SB folds, BB folds.
Flop K72r: BTN small_cbet_33 ~6.5bb targeting broadways and small pairs; CO calls.
Turn 5x: BTN half_pot_50 to deny equity versus 7x/pp/gutters and to set river geometry.
If the flop were T98ss, BTN would size_up_wet with big_bet_75 only with strong equity; otherwise protect_check_range.

Common mistakes
- Copying full-ring opens 4-5 handed. Why it is a mistake: leaves EV on the table or opens into bad seats. Why it happens: habit and fear of 3-bets.
- Auto small_cbet_33 on dynamic boards then calling raises without a plan. Why it is a mistake: grants cheap realization then pays off polar lines. Why it happens: overgeneralizing dry-board success.
- Barreling river without triple_barrel_scare conditions. Why it is a mistake: burns chips into sticky bluff-catchers. Why it happens: commitment bias after turn barrel.

Mini-glossary
3bet_ip_9bb / 3bet_oop_12bb: short-handed 3-bet size families by position to keep leverage and SPR in line.
4bet_ip_21bb / 4bet_oop_24bb: standard 4-bet ladders that set low SPR and preserve fold equity.
small_cbet_33 / half_pot_50 / big_bet_75: core sizing families mapped to dry, middling, and dynamic textures.
protect_check_range / delay_turn / probe_turns / double_barrel_good / triple_barrel_scare: tools to realize equity and apply pressure at the right moments.

Contrast
Full-ring instincts fail here; short-handed rewards wider first-in, disciplined 3-bet/4-bet ladders, and texture-driven small_cbet_33 with timely delay_turn and probe_turns.

_This module uses the fixed families and sizes: size_down_dry, size_up_wet; small_cbet_33, half_pot_50, big_bet_75._
