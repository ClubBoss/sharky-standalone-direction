What it is
Heads-Up river play is the last betting decision after single-raised or 3-bet pots. You choose between thin value, bluffs, and bluff-catches using blocker logic: block value, unblock bluffs. You weigh capped vs uncapped ranges and pick disciplined sizes: size_down_dry for thin value on static boards, half_pot_50 for balanced value/bluff, and big_bet_75 for polar pressure. You also decide when to triple_barrel_scare and when to protect_check_range so you are not blown off equity.

Why it matters
The river has the highest price per mistake. Pools overfold to big polar bets, under-bluff scary runouts, and call too wide versus half-pot on static boards. Clear rules keep your value bets called by worse, your bluffs chosen with the right blockers, and your bluff-catches selective and profitable.

Rules of thumb

* Thin value on static boards: prefer size_down_dry on A-high or K-high rainbows and paired low runouts; move to half_pot_50 only when you beat many bluff-catchers and expect calls. Why: smaller sizing retains worse hands and avoids pricing out calls.
* Polar pressure: use big_bet_75 when you are polar with nut advantage or key blockers, and reserve triple_barrel_scare for credible scare rivers that fit your story. Why: large bets demand leverage and blocker support to print folds.
* Blocker discipline: bluff more when you block villain value and unblock bluffs; bluff-catch more when you block value and do not block bluffs. Why: blockers shift combos in your favor and raise EV on either side.
* Capped vs uncapped: check back more when your range is capped and villain is uncapped; attack capped ranges after chk-chk lines on scary turns. Why: attacking uncapped ranges is costly; attacking capped ones is efficient.
* OOP defense and pool exploits: protect_check_range on rivers that invite stabs, and fold without blockers versus polar pressure. Tag overfold_exploit against opponents who overfold to big_bet_75. Why: protected checks defend vs probes; exploitative adjustments add EV.

Mini example
UTG, MP, CO are not seated in HU. BTN SB bets flop K72r small, turn 5x half pot; BB calls both. River 2x bricks draws. Pot ~18bb, stacks 60bb. With KJ, BTN chooses size_down_dry 4.5bb targeting Kx worse kickers, 7x, and stubborn pairs; half_pot_50 risks folding out the exact bluff-catchers you want to keep. With A3s (missed wheel), bluffing is poor because you block A-high folds and do not unblock missed straights; prefer check back. Versus a BB polar shove, KJ folds when it blocks few bluffs and loses to value; call improves only when you unblock bluffs and block two-pair.

Common mistakes

* Betting thin value too big on static rivers. Why it is a mistake: you price out bluff-catchers and get called only by better; Why players do it: anchoring on earlier street sizes and fear of missing value.
* Bluffing when you block folds. Why it is a mistake: holding the missed draw removes villain bluffs and their folds; Why players do it: focusing on hand strength instead of blocker effects.
* Calling large polar bets without blockers. Why it is a mistake: you face value-heavy ranges and block few bluffs; Why players do it: curiosity and overestimating population bluff rates.

Mini-glossary
size_down_dry: smaller river value bet on static boards to keep worse hands in.
half_pot_50: balanced river size for value and bluffs when neither extreme fits.
big_bet_75: polar large bet used when leverage and blockers align.
triple_barrel_scare: third barrel on a credible scare card with appropriate blockers.
protect_check_range: checking some strong hands so your calls are protected.
bettor_shows_first, first_active_left_of_btn_shows, first_active_left_of_btn: showdown order reminder; if there is a river bet, bettor_shows_first, else first_active_left_of_btn_shows.

Contrast
Compared to turn play, river decisions rely more on blockers and range caps than equity growth; in HU you can polarize more often, but only when the story, blockers, and range advantage support the size, otherwise keep it thin and disciplined.

_This module uses the fixed families and sizes: size_down_dry, size_up_wet; small_cbet_33, half_pot_50, big_bet_75._
