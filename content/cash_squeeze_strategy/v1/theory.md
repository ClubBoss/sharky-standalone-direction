What it is
Squeezing is a 3-bet over an open when at least one caller has entered. It prints because you collect dead money, punish loose flats, and force poor realization for dominated hands. Primary lanes: IP squeezes from CO/BTN over EP/MP/CO opens with caller(s); OOP squeezes from the blinds over late opens plus a call. Baselines (typical online): 3bet_ip_9bb versus 2.2-2.5bb opens with no caller; squeeze_ip_12bb versus open + 1 caller; squeeze_oop_14bb from blinds versus open + 1 caller.

Why it matters
Multiway crushes fold equity and creates tough, bloated decisions. A good squeeze reclaims initiative, lowers SPR, and shifts the rake share as pots grow. With the right geometry your value hands win bigger pots and your bluffs use blockers to pull folds; with poor geometry you invite multiway and make dominated, low-realization calls.

Rules of thumb
- When to squeeze. Prefer squeeze over flat when the caller is loose, the opener wide, and you hold blockers or a strong value candidate. Flat more IP versus tight opener + strong caller; avoid_bloated_pot_oop with marginal offsuit hands. Why: dead money plus blockers add immediate EV while avoiding low-SR, multiway nodes.
- Sizing ladders. squeeze_ip_12bb versus open + 1 caller; add +1-2bb per extra caller. squeeze_oop_14bb from blinds; add +1-2bb per caller. size_up_wet when deep (120bb+) to keep pressure; size_down_dry at 40-60bb to preserve clean jam trees. Why: correct sizes isolate, hold SPR in stack-off bands, and prevent cheap overcalls.
- Range shapes. Be more value-biased than standard 3-bets. Use pairs, broadways, and Axs/Kxs as block_3bet_bluff_combo; trim low-equity bluffs OOP. Why: callers cap ranges and under-4-bet; value captures dead money while blockers reduce 4-bet frequency.
- Versus 4-bets. fold_vs_4bet with bluffs; jam_vs_4bet_shallow with QQ+/AK at 40-60bb; call_ip_realize selectively versus tight 4-bets with suited broadways that realize well. Why: protect equity when ahead and avoid dominated, low-SPR calls.
- Postflop map. IP favors small_cbet_33 on Axx/Kxx dry to tax broadways; half_pot_50 on middling textures; big_bet_75 only with strong equity on dynamic boards. Mix delay_cbet_ip and probe_turns. OOP protect_check_range, defend tighter versus raises, and deny_equity_turn on scare or improving cards. Why: textures and position drive denial and value extraction.

Mini example
CO opens 2.5bb, BTN calls, SB folds, BB squeezes to 14bb (squeeze_oop_14bb). CO calls, BTN folds. Pot ~31bb; stacks ~86bb; SPR ~2.8. Flop A72r: BB small_cbet_33 ~10bb to tax KQ/QJ/77-99; CO calls. Turn 5x adds wheel gutters; BB half_pot_50 ~16bb to deny_equity_turn versus 86/A5. CO folds. Plan worked by isolating, then using small on dry flop and pressure as new equity arrives.

Common mistakes
- Flatting OOP and inviting multiway. Why it is a mistake: poor realization and awkward SPRs; why it happens: fear of 4-bets and overrating suitedness or a blocker.
- Using open sizes instead of squeeze sizes. Why it is a mistake: invites multiway and kills initiative; why it happens: copying a standard 3-bet ladder without caller adjustments.
- Calling 4-bets without blockers or position. Why it is a mistake: dominated at low SPR; why it happens: sunk-cost bias after committing chips preflop.

Mini-glossary
squeeze_ip_12bb: IP squeeze versus open + 1 caller; add +1-2bb per extra caller.
squeeze_oop_14bb: OOP squeeze from blinds versus open + 1 caller; add +1-2bb per caller.
block_3bet_bluff_combo: Axs/Kxs used as blocker bluffs to reduce 4-bet frequency.
call_ip_realize: IP flat versus tight 4-bet with hands that realize well.
EV: Expected value; average profit of a line across many repeats.

Contrast
Compared to standard 3-bet pots, squeeze ranges are more value-biased and sizes larger to punish callers. Compared to single-raised multiway, you reclaim initiative, lower SPR, and rely less on thin bluffs while pressing blocker and value edges.
