What it is
This module explains how rake and antes shift incentives and how to convert those shifts into **frequency** changes using the same ladders and size families. We never change sizes. We only adjust how often we use: 3bet_ip_9bb, 3bet_oop_12bb, 4bet_ip_21bb, 4bet_oop_24bb, small_cbet_33, half_pot_50, big_bet_75, size_up_wet, size_down_dry, protect_check_range, delay_turn, probe_turns, double_barrel_good, triple_barrel_scare, call, fold, overfold_exploit. Texture still rules: size_down_dry on static boards, size_up_wet on dynamic boards.

Why it matters
Rake taxes small pots and weak realization, especially OOP. That favors tighter flats OOP and more value heavy 3 bets. Antes add dead money, rewarding steals and pressure. These economics change EV/hour more than micro in hand tweaks. You keep the same ladders and 33/50/75 sizes, but you shift frequencies-especially preflop and on turn/river pressure nodes.

Rules of thumb


* **Rake light/rake free (HU SNG, app games, FT):** widen opens and defends; add **overfold_exploit** if folds rise; ladders unchanged. *Why:* less tax makes steals and calls more profitable.
* **Ante present (MTT/FT):** dead money -> widen **3bet_ip_9bb** and **3bet_oop_12bb** with blockers; postflop favor **half_pot_50** to tax wide ranges; still **size_up_wet** and consider **big_bet_75** on dynamic boards. *Why:* antes boost pot to stack leverage.
* **Rake bands (quick compass):** if effective rake feels **6-8 bb/100**, avoid thin OOP flats and light river bluff catches; if low, defend a bit wider IP and keep standard calls. *Why:* realization tax scales with rake.
* **SPR mapping unchanged:** **3bet_ip_9bb / 3bet_oop_12bb / 4bet_ip_21bb / 4bet_oop_24bb** stay fixed; shift **frequency** only. *Why:* consistency reduces errors.
* **Rivers in rakey pools:** rake is already paid, but populations tend to under bluff big. **Fold** more vs **big_bet_75** without blockers. *Why:* pool effect dominates.
* **Antes vs stations:** with antes, merged calling increases. Choose **half_pot_50** more for value; keep **size_down_dry** for thin value on static. *Why:* tax the width.
* **Probing after check check:** ante fields surrender more turns. Use **probe_turns** more when sequence favors it. *Why:* dead money plus passivity.
* **Delay under rake:** when turn raises spike OOP in rakey cash, use **delay_turn** with medium strength to realize. *Why:* avoid paying extra rake via spew lines.

Mini example
Same HU BTN vs BB, 100bb. Flop A83r.

* **Rake heavy cash:** BTN opens 2.0bb; BB defends tighter OOP. BTN uses **small_cbet_33** (**size_down_dry**). Versus a turn brick, prefer **half_pot_50** with strong value and **delay_turn** more with medium. Preflop, BTN expects fewer light 4 bets, so value 3 bets and **4bet_ip_21bb** with premiums perform well. River facing **big_bet_75** from a tight pool without blockers -> **fold**.
* **Ante MTT:** BTN open gets defended wider. BTN still **small_cbet_33** on A83r, but on many turns prefers **half_pot_50** to tax the width. Preflop, widen **3bet_ip_9bb** and **3bet_oop_12bb** with blockers; tag **overfold_exploit** if blinds fold too much.

Common mistakes

* Copying rake free ranges to rakey cash. **Fix:** tighten OOP flats; add **3bet_oop_12bb** value.
* Inventing off tree sizes to "beat the rake." **Fix:** keep **33/50/75**; move frequencies.
* Over calling OOP because the price "looks close." **Fix:** consider realization tax; **fold** or **3bet_oop_12bb**.
* Over pressuring dry boards with **big_bet_75** in rakey pools. **Fix:** **size_down_dry** or **half_pot_50** unless blockers and fold equity are clear.
* Ignoring ante leverage. **Fix:** add **3bet_ip_9bb / 3bet_oop_12bb** with blockers and use **half_pot_50** to tax wide ranges.

Mini-glossary
**Rake:** fee taken from the pot; increases the cost of low realization lines. 
**Ante:** forced contribution preflop; adds dead money and widens ranges. 
**Realization tax:** equity lost due to position/rake; higher OOP and in rakey games. 
**Dead money:** chips in the pot not backed by strong ranges; increases steal EV. 
**SPR:** stack to pot ratio; ladders fix SPR; economics shift frequency, not size.

Contrast
Math and ICM cover prices and payout pressure. Here we layer rake/ante economics on top: physics and sizes stay the same; only frequencies move through the same tokens.
