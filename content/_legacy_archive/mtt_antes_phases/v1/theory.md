What it is
This module organizes play by ante phase in 9-max MTTs: pre-ante (no antes, conservative opening ranges), early-ante (reduced antes, moderate widening), and full-ante (standard antes, maximum stealing ranges). Antes add dead money to every pot and lower everyone's required defense thresholds, making steals more profitable and folds more expensive. Early positions (UTG, MP) exist in 9-max and should stay tighter for longer, while late positions (CO, BTN, SB) expand ranges most aggressively as antes rise and fold equity improves.

Why it matters
Antes change risk-reward and geometry. Pots start larger, steals print more, and folding gives up more equity. SPR falls faster after 3-bets, so initiative and position gain value. Pools under-4bet and overfold turns; a phase-aware plan converts those leaks into chips.

Rules of thumb
- Preflop by phase: pre-ante keep UTG and MP disciplined and reduce OOP flats; early-ante widen CO/BTN steals; full-ante add SB steals and defend BB wider vs small opens. dead money improves price and realization for late seats.
- Size families: use 3bet_ip_9bb vs late steals; 3bet_oop_12bb from blinds; keep 4bet_ip_21bb value-heavy vs tight 3-bettors and mix 4bet_oop_24bb sparingly. these sizes preserve leverage and clean SPR across phases.
- Multiway control: with more players behind in 9-max, prefer 3bet_oop_12bb over loose flats OOP; add squeezes in prose only, but map to our size families. dominated multiway spots create bad SPRs on turns and rivers.
- Flop and turn defaults: small_cbet_33 on dry Axx/Kxx; half_pot_50 when ranges are closer; big_bet_75 only with size_up_wet and real equity. OOP on middling textures, use protect_check_range. texture-fit sizing prints and avoids spew.
- Turn and river levers: delay_turn and probe_turns gain power as antes rise; tag overfold_exploit where pools fold too much. Choose double_barrel_good on range cards and triple_barrel_scare on credible river scares. you shift pressure to the streets opponents misplay most.

Mini example
Pre-ante: UTG opens 2.2bb, MP folds, CO folds, BTN calls, SB folds, BB calls. Flop A72r: UTG small_cbet_33; BTN folds, BB calls. Turn 4x: UTG half_pot_50 as double_barrel_good with Ax; check more with KQ.
Full-ante: CO opens 2.3bb, BTN 3bet_ip_9bb, SB folds, BB folds, CO calls. Flop J96r: CO protect_check_range; turn Qx improves BTN who fires half_pot_50; river A enables triple_barrel_scare when blockers align.

Common mistakes
- Copying pre-ante frequencies into full-ante. opens too tight and steals missed. Why it happens: anchoring to earlier phases.
- Flatting too much OOP in early seats. you invite dominated multiway spots; 3bet_oop_12bb performs better. Why it happens: fear of building pots preflop.
- Auto big_bet_75 without equity on dynamic turns. you get raised or torch EV; half_pot_50 or delay_turn fits better. Why it happens: size inertia.

Mini-glossary
Pre-ante / early-ante / full-ante: phases defined by antes that change ranges and prices.
overfold_exploit: intentional pressure where pools fold too much, often on turns.
protect_check_range: OOP checks that keep medium hands and avoid face-up lines.
delay_turn / probe_turns: bet the turn after prior street checks (IP/OOP).
small_cbet_33 / half_pot_50 / big_bet_75: core size families mapped to texture.
3bet_ip_9bb / 3bet_oop_12bb / 4bet_ip_21bb / 4bet_oop_24bb: preflop size families to keep leverage and SPR in line.
