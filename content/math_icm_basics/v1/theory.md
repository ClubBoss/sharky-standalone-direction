What it is
This module introduces ICM for tournaments and shows how payout pressure changes decisions. You will compare chipEV to $EV, use bubble factor and risk premium to tighten calls and 4-bets, and pick safer postflop sizes. You will map the math to actions using only: 3bet_ip_9bb, 3bet_oop_12bb, 4bet_ip_21bb, 4bet_oop_24bb, small_cbet_33, half_pot_50, big_bet_75, size_up_wet, size_down_dry, protect_check_range, delay_turn, probe_turns, double_barrel_good, triple_barrel_scare, call, fold, overfold_exploit.

Why it matters
Near a bubble or final table, losing chips hurts more than winning the same number helps. That asymmetry raises calling thresholds, tightens value ranges, and favors smaller, lower-volatility lines. Players who ignore ICM spew stacks; players who respect it print $EV by folding thin, sizing down, and attacking capped ranges with discipline instead of ego.

Rules of thumb
- ChipEV vs $EV: chipEV maximizes chips, $EV weights survival; why: payout ladders make future chips nonlinear, so fold more in marginal spots and reduce variance.
- Bubble factor: elimination risk raises the equity needed to call; why: your stack's future $EV drops sharply if you bust, so require stronger hands or key blockers before continuing.
- Preflop ladders tighten: 3bet_oop_12bb and 4bet_ip_21bb shrink in frequency while flats rise; why: fewer coins and less variance protect $EV when ranges are already strong.
- Postflop sizing: prefer size_down_dry and half_pot_50, use big_bet_75 sparingly as a bluff, and keep protect_check_range; why: smaller bets keep pots manageable and avoid capped nodes that get punished.
- Exploits: populations overfold to big_bet_75 and under-bluff rivers under ICM; why: fear of busting makes them passive, so overfold_exploit selectively and make disciplined river folds without blockers.

Mini example
UTG folds, MP folds, CO folds. BTN opens 2.2bb at 50bb effective. 
SB jams 28bb. BB holds AQs. Bubble factor raises the call bar; with the ace blocker BB is closer, but many lineups still fold. 
Same table: BTN folds, SB opens 2.0bb at 80bb. BB would 3bet_oop_12bb in cash, but under ICM prefers flat unless pool overfolds, then overfold_exploit. 
On A83r in SRP, BTN favors small_cbet_33 or half_pot_50; big_bet_75 bluffs decline to control variance.

Common mistakes
- Copying cash-game ladders. Mistake: wide 3-bets and loose calls lose $EV; why players do it: they optimize chipEV habits and ignore risk premium near pay jumps.
- Oversizing bluffs. Mistake: big_bet_75 with low fold equity burns stacks; why players do it: they chase immediate folds and forget ICM makes opponents call narrower but raise less.
- Calling jams without blockers. Mistake: bubble factor is ignored and calls are under-equitized; why players do it: they anchor to chipEV charts and overlook how ace or king blockers change $EV.

Mini-glossary
ChipEV: expected chips gained; ignores payouts. 
$EV: expected prize money; includes payout risk. 
Bubble factor: ratio showing how costly losing is versus winning; raises call thresholds. 
Risk premium: extra equity needed to justify playing a pot under ICM.

Contrast
Math_ev_calculations optimizes chips; this module adjusts the same actions and sizes to maximize $EV by tightening ladders and preferring safer lines under payout pressure.
