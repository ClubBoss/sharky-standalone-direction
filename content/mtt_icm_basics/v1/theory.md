What it is
ICM (Independent Chip Model) means chips do not equal cash. Busting costs future payout equity, so calling off requires more equity than in chips-EV. Risk premium is highest for medium stacks near pay jumps, lower for big stacks who cover, and moderate for shorts who are often forced to take spots.

Why it matters
When money jumps loom, chips lost hurt more than chips won help. That shifts good chips-EV calls into folds, especially when covered. Clear preflop shove/reshove trees reduce tough postflop spots. Postflop, prefer pot control OOP and choose pressure only when blockers and coverage favor you.

Rules of thumb
- Stack roles: big stacks apply pressure; medium stacks avoid thin calls and flats OOP; short stacks pick clean shove/call-off trees rather than speculative calls.
- Preflop ladders: map shove/reshove to 3bet_ip_9bb and 3bet_oop_12bb proxies; keep 4bet_ip_21bb and 4bet_oop_24bb value-lean. Bluff 4-bets are rare under ICM.
- Coverage logic: tighten call-offs when covered; widen slightly when you cover. Late-position steals widen for big stacks; calling ranges tighten.
- Postflop: small_cbet_33 on dry when uncapped and safe. half_pot_50 only when it sets a clean commit line with value+equity. Avoid big_bet_75 without clear size_up_wet equity and narrative.
- Line selection: protect_check_range more OOP to avoid stack-off. delay_turn and probe_turns only when the turn meaningfully shifts ranges and risk is acceptable.
- Exploits: mediums overfold turns when covered - tag overfold_exploit and press. Avoid hero-calls without blockers; fold is fine under ICM.
- Geometry: plan flop+turn to avoid all-in confrontations when covered. Prefer fold over thin peels that create dominated rivers.

Mini example
Bubble, 9-max. CO 35bb opens 2.2bb and is covered by BTN 60bb and blinds. BTN responds with 3bet_ip_9bb (reshove-proxy). CO folds KJo that would be a chips-EV defend, because covered and risk premium is high. If CO had AQo, choose 4bet_ip_21bb only when BTN is loose and there is a shorter stack elsewhere; otherwise fold. Postflop is mostly avoided by using clean preflop trees.

Common mistakes
- Calling off because it is barely chips-EV while covered. Under ICM, that is a punt; fold and keep ladder equity.
- Flatting OOP with medium stack to "see a flop." You invite bad SPR and tough call-offs; prefer 3bet_oop_12bb shove-proxy or fold.
- Vanity turn barrels when covered. Use half_pot_50 only with value+equity; otherwise protect_check_range and realize.
- Bluff 4-betting tight players. Under ICM, keep 4bet_ip_21bb and 4bet_oop_24bb value-lean.
- Triple-barreling scare cards without blockers or coverage advantage. Your story must fit.

Mini-glossary
Risk premium: extra equity required to continue because busting costs payout equity.
Covered: opponent has you out-chipped; your bust risk is higher.
3bet_ip_9bb / 3bet_oop_12bb: shove/reshove family proxies to simplify trees under ICM.
4bet_ip_21bb / 4bet_oop_24bb: value-lean 4-bet families; bluffing rare.
small_cbet_33 / half_pot_50 / big_bet_75: size families; choose smaller and safer under ICM pressure.
protect_check_range / delay_turn / probe_turns: lines to control risk or time aggression.
overfold_exploit: node where population folds too much under pressure.

Contrast
Versus chips-EV deep-stack play, ICM shifts value from thin calls and bluffs toward folds and jam-first trees. You win by avoiding dominated commitments when covered and by applying disciplined, blocker-backed pressure when you cover.

_This module uses the fixed families and sizes: size_down_dry, size_up_wet; small_cbet_33, half_pot_50, big_bet_75._
